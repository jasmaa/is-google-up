# Is Google Up

Have you ever wondered if Google is still up? I sure have. Sometimes I just lie
there in my bed, staring at the ceiling and thinking to myself, "Is Google still
up? Why? Has Google ever returned a non-2xx status code or timed out? What
happens if Google experiences a prolonged outage? Will modern society is we know
it crumble; ashes to ashes, dust to dust? And why is it always DNS?"
